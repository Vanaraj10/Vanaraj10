Hi there 👋, I'm VJ!
<br/>

👨‍💻 I'm a Computer Science student forging my path to becoming a Software Developer.

🚀 I love building scalable and efficient solutions with Go. My playground spans from full-stack web/app development to DevOps automation.

🧠 I'm currently exploring the practical side of AI & ML to create smarter, more intuitive applications.

📫 I'm open to collaboration and always ready to talk tech. Let's build something that matters!
